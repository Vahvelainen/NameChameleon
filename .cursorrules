# NameMasker Project Rules

## Environment
- Use venv for virtual environment management

## Code Style
- Use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approach
- Empty __init__.py files only (no code in init files)
- Do not add non-informative comments or docstrings
- Use absolute imports (e.g., `from anonymization.core.anonymizer import Anonymizer`)
- Try to add type hints, but use `Any` if type hints become too cumbersome

## Architecture
- Keep the base anonymizer as a configurable class for extensibility
- Handle Excel sheets separately
- Support different column types: first_name, last_name, full_name, email, id, misc
